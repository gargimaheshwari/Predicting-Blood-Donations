# Predicting Blood Donations
Using TPOT and linear regression to predict second time blood donors.
Predictive and diagnostic analysis using Python. 

In this Jupyter Notebook I use TPOT to find the best model for predicting blood donations and then use linear regression to make said prediction. The dataset is from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan, which drives to university campuses and collects blood as part of a blood drive.
